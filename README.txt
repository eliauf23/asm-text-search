MS1: Elizabeth took the lead with the functions and Rosie took the lead with unit testing. We worked together on general planning/debugging.

MS2: We worked together to implement and debug the first assembly function.

MS3: 

We implemented read_line, print_line, (and fixed the MS2 versions of) find_string_length, and strings_equal together.

Rosie implemented count_occurrences & find_all_occurrences and Elizabeth debugged it.
Elizabeth implemented the main function and Rosie debugged it.
